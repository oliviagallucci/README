### Steps

### Modifications 

2. Be concise
People have incredibly short attention spans. Cut all the excess wording out of your READ-ME and get down to brass tacks.

## Releases

  * Versions are separated into major, minor, patch and pre-release. The identifiers below from left to right: major, minor, and patch versions are always compared numerically.
    * Example: 1.0.0 < 2.0.0 < 2.1.0 < 2.1.1.
* Pre-release examples
  * 1.0.0-alpha 
    * testing is done by developers only
  * 1.0.0-beta
    * testing is done by users and developers 

## Authors
